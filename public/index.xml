      <description>About meHey, Welcome to my bio. You could pronouce my name as “Uck-Shut” or “j-aim-es bo-nd”
My recent lifeAn undergraduate degree in computer science introduced me to programming and data-oriented courses. Then I made the toughest choice of my life - Get a consulting or Technology job after my Masters at London Business School or open my own bar and spend the rest of my life serving drinks for the greater good of mankind.</description>

      <description>Millions of people across the world suffer from various mobility impairments caused by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, brain or spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophies, multiple sclerosis, and many other diseases.A large portion of these people heavily rely upon wheelchairs to get on with their day to day activities.
These people are dependent on others in order to move. A large number of patients are not prescribed wheelchairs at all, because they find it physically difficult to control the manual wheelchair.</description>

      <description>Challenge 1: Brexit plotThe graph shows how party affiliation affected votes for Brexit. It is evident that UK Independence party supporters had the highest votes for Brexit. The analysis of data shows the predictability of a brexit like vote based on political affiliations and this could lead to parties making laws based on predictive affiliations rather than pure good of the nation.

      <description>Youth Risk Behavior SurveillanceEvery two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. We will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.
We mainly compare the weight of youth and check if that correlates with fitness and test if our assumptions are true.</description>
